== David's Sample App

This application presents a list of restaurants for users to search. The user can place an order for a meal, choosing from the items available on the menu.

Restaurant administrators and super-users can add items to the menus. Menus are arranged by menu section. Administrative functions are linked to in the top menu.

There are two classes of users: super-user (login in with admin/admin), and restuarant-specific admins. If you use the db:populate task, you may log in
with rest<restaurant.id> / "password".

== Getting Started

rake db:migrate db:populate

Tests are written in Rspec. Run rake db:test:prepare && rspec spec/ to execute.
